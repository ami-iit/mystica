## :hammer: Dependencies

- [`matlab`](https://mathworks.com/)

Other requisites are:

- [`casadi`](https://web.casadi.org/)
- [`yamlmatlab`](https://github.com/ewiger/yamlmatlab)

Both [`casadi`](https://web.casadi.org/) and [`yamlmatlab`](https://github.com/ewiger/yamlmatlab) are downloaded and configured in section [Installation](#floppy_disk-installation).

## :floppy_disk: Installation

1. Clone the repo:

``` cmd
git clone https://github.com/ami-iit/mystica.git
cd mystica
```

2. Run the matlab function [`install()`](install.m).
``` matlab
install()
```
The function [`install()`](install.m) downloads [`mambaforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). [`mambaforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) is a package manager that downloads and configures our dependencies in conda enviroment called `mystica`.\
If you already have [`mambaforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) configured, you can call [`install()`](install.m) function defining `mambaforge_prefix` value:

``` matlab
install('mambaforge_prefix',<your mambaforge path prefix>)
```

## :rocket: Usage

 Before every usage remember to run the autogenerated matlab file called `deps/setup.m` to setup the `MATLABPATH`.

Alternatively, you can launch matlab from terminal after having activated the conda enviroment called `mystica`:
``` cmd
mamba activate mystica
matlab
```
